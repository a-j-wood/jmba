Things still to do:

  * release all messages from sender once one response received
  * UTF-7 decoding: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2152.html
  * http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3834.html
  * unit tests
  * system-wide daemon to run instead of per-user cron jobs
  * example CGI script to handle URLs
  * get more translations

Any assistance would be appreciated.
